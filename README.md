# Agentic AI Projects 🧠🤖  

Welcome! 👋  

This repository contains all the **Agentic AI projects** I’ve developed.  
Each project focuses on building **autonomous, goal-driven AI agents** that can reason, plan, take actions, and collaborate to solve complex real-world problems.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each folder represents a **separate Agentic AI project**.  
- Projects typically include:  
  - Intelligent agents with memory & reasoning  
  - Task planning and decision-making workflows  
  - Tool usage (APIs, databases, web, files, code execution)  
  - Multi-step reasoning & self-reflection loops  
  - Single-agent and multi-agent systems  
  - Autonomous task execution & orchestration  
  - Human-in-the-loop controls  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The aim of this repo is to:  
- Apply **Agentic AI concepts** to real-world automation and decision systems.  
- Showcase skills in **autonomous agents, planning, reasoning, and orchestration**.  
- Build scalable AI agents that can operate beyond simple prompt–response behavior.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
Most projects are built using **Python** and modern Agentic AI frameworks such as:  
- `LangChain Agents`, `CrewAI`, `AutoGen`  
- `OpenAI / LLM APIs`  
- `Tools & Function Calling`  
- `Vector Databases (FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone)` for memory  
- `FastAPI / Streamlit` for agent interaction & dashboards  

## ⚠️ Note  
- Agents are designed with **safety, transparency, and controllability** in mind.  
- API keys, credentials, and secrets are **never committed** to the repository.  
- Each project folder includes a detailed **README** explaining:  
  - Agent goals  
  - Architecture  
  - Tools used  
  - Execution flow  

## 💡 Contribution  
Contributions are welcome!  
- Propose new **Agentic AI use cases**  
- Improve agent reasoning, planning, or efficiency  
- Add multi-agent collaboration patterns  
- Enhance observability and evaluation  

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
